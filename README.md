# FocusDeck — Unique To‑Do App

A designer‑ish, offline To‑Do app that saves to **localStorage**. No frameworks, no backend.
- Drag‑to‑reorder
- Priorities (low/normal/high)
- Due dates, smart filters (Today, Overdue)
- Tags (#tag filter), search, keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+K)
- Import/Export JSON
- Minimal, original UI

## Run
Open `index.html` in your browser. That's it.
